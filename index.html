            <article class="content">
                <p><strong>President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud‚Äôs</strong> return to Villa Somalia in 2022 was historic. As the first Somali president to be re-elected in a non-consecutive term, he had the rare opportunity to lead with the benefit of hindsight ‚Äî a second chance to reflect on what worked, correct what didn‚Äôt, and realign the nation toward lasting peace and statehood.</p>

                <p>His campaign message, <em>‚ÄúSomali heshiis ah, dunida la heshiis ah‚Äù</em> ‚Äî <em>‚ÄúA Somalia at peace with itself and with the world‚Äù</em> ‚Äî was both timely and ambitious, echoing the national yearning for reconciliation and re-engagement after years of fragmentation and violence.</p>

                <h2>‚úÖ Notable Accomplishments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Security Gains in Mogadishu:</strong> The capital has seen a marked reduction in high-profile terrorist attacks ‚Äî the most stable period in over a decade.</li>
                    <li><strong>Debt Relief and Sovereignty Restoration:</strong> Somalia secured debt relief and the UN arms embargo was lifted.</li>
                    <li><strong>East African Integration and Diplomacy:</strong> Somalia joined the East African Community and secured a 2025 UN Security Council seat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Executive Cohesion:</strong> A stable working partnership with PM Hamza Abdi Barre ‚Äî rare in Somali politics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defending Sovereignty:</strong> Rejected Ethiopia‚Äôs Somaliland deal, reaffirming Somalia‚Äôs territorial integrity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>‚ö† Strategic Missteps and Leadership Gaps</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Macawisley Militia:</strong> Grassroots tribal militia lost momentum due to poor coordination and lack of oversight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Military Instability:</strong> Flip-flopping on army leadership during a key offensive undermined cohesion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Municipal Disruption:</strong> Frequent mayor changes in Mogadishu harmed urban governance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Political Deals Over Democracy:</strong> Extended regional president terms in exchange for loyalty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neglected Anti-Corruption:</strong> Corruption persists, especially in public land and contracts.</li>
                    <li><strong>IDP Evictions:</strong> Mass evictions of displaced people without support has worsened the humanitarian crisis.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>üß≠ The Broader Political Class</h2>
                <p>Somalia‚Äôs dysfunction is not due to one leader. The opposition, many of whom failed in prior roles, offers little vision. Somalia needs principled leadership, not recycled ambition.</p>

                <h2>üí° Constructive Recommendations</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Hold National Elections On Time:</strong> Even imperfect elections are better than indefinite delays.</li>
                    <li><strong>Establish Independent Judiciary:</strong> Start with Mogadishu to restore confidence in justice.</li>
                    <li><strong>End Inhumane Evictions:</strong> Develop a national urban displacement policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Invest in True Reconciliation:</strong> Peace depends on genuine clan and generational healing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Support Selfless Leaders:</strong> Integrity and service must replace status and profit motives.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>üìå Conclusion: A Legacy in the Balance</h2>
                <p>President Hassan Sheikh‚Äôs second term brought tangible progress and persistent contradictions. He showed reform is possible ‚Äî but fragile. Whether his legacy is transformation or lost potential depends on what comes next ‚Äî from him, and from all of us.</p>

                <p>Somalia‚Äôs future will not be secured by slogans or military might. It will be forged by reconciliation, justice, and unity. Let this be the generation that chooses service over self, and peace over power.</p>
